### üìñ Description

**My Memory Monitor** is an applet for Linux Mint that displays the system's cache memory usage in real-time on the panel. It is useful for monitoring memory usage directly from your desktop without the need to open any other monitoring tools.

### üåà Features

-   ‚è±Ô∏è **Real-time memory monitoring**: Shows the amount of cache memory used on your system.
-   üîÑ **Customizable refresh rate**: Allows you to set how frequently the applet updates the memory information.
-   üìä **Visual indicator**: Displays memory usage with graphical elements, such as pie charts or progress bars (if applicable).
-   üí¨ **Tooltip information**: Provides detailed memory statistics on hover.

### üì• Installation

### üìã Requirements

-   **Linux Mint** with the Cinnamon desktop environment.
-   No additional dependencies are required for the basic functionality.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (Optional)

If your applet includes additional configuration options, describe them here. For example:
